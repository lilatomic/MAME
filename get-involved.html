                There are many different ways to get involved within the engineering community. If you want to check out all the different clubs, committees and teams under the EUS, check out their involvement page <a href="https://mcgilleus.ca/eus-groups">here</a>.

                If you want to dedicate your time to MAME, we definitely have something for you! Most of our VPs have a sub-committee and we guarantee an unbelievable experience.

                    <p>The First Year Council (FYC) is a committee under the MAME Council run by U0/U1 students. They organize events specifically for first year mechies in order to help them transition and socialize during their first year at McGill. Interested in being on the committee? Come to the MAME office any weekday between 10am and 4pm to ask us about it!

                    <h3>Volunteering</h3>
                    <!--This should probably be on the image, not inside-->
                    <p>Volunteers consist of people under the MAME Council who are U0 to U100 mechanical engineering students. Volunteers are crucial when we need that extra man(-woman) power during our events. Whether it’s being in charge serving food or drinks at Blues Pub or Bluesy Brunch, lending a hand at Apartment Crawl, helping us setup for events, MAME has a job for you! Sign up to get emails when we are calling out for volunteers.

                    <p>The Communications Committee is run by the elected Ureps and any mechie who wants to join. Their goal is to keep our mechies updated on everything MAME-related such as events, opportunities and important resources through the website, the weekly Newsletter and social media. We also need photographers, whether you have your own camera or not! If communications is something that interests you, <a href="mailto:mame.vpcomm@mcgilleus.ca">send an email</a>!

                    <h3>MAME Council &amp; Elections</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">MAME Council is run by representatives elected by the mechanical engineering students at McGill. There are eight executive positions: President, VP Internal, VP External, VP Finance, VP Academic, VP Events, VP Communications and VP Administration. Each executive has their respective responsibilities, but almost every task is completed with the help of everyone.
                    <br><br>
                    There are also class reps for each year. Their job is to keep their peers informed about MAME and EUS news and events. They also work to promote departmental and faculty spirit, and to give a voice to student concerns.
                    <br><br>
                    Want to join MAME Council? MAME holds elections every spring, and everyone is encouraged to run regardless of experience. It is important to note that the positions of U0, U1 Rep and VP Administration are reserved for first year mechanical engineering students. Therefore, the elections are held in the fall.
