                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">MAME Council is run by representatives elected by the mechanical engineering students at McGill. There are eight executive positions: President, VP Internal, VP External, VP Finance, VP Academic, VP Events, VP Communications and VP Administration. Each executive has their respective responsibilities, but almost every task is completed with the help of everyone.
                    <br><br>
                    There are also class reps for each year. Their job is to keep their peers informed about MAME and EUS news and events. They also work to promote departmental and faculty spirit, and to give a voice to student concerns.
                    <br><br>
                    Want to join MAME Council? MAME holds elections every spring, and everyone is encouraged to run regardless of experience. It is important to note that the positions of U0, U1 Rep and VP Administration are reserved for first year mechanical engineering students. Therefore, the elections are held in the fall.
