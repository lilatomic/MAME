        <div>
            <h2><b>Volunteers</b></h2>
            <p>Volunteers consist of any mechanical engineering undergraduates who are interested in assisting MAME. Volunteers are crucial when we need that extra man(-woman) power during our events. Whether itâ€™s being in charge of photography, serving food or drinks at Blues Pub, lending a hand at an Apartment Crawl, MAME has a job for you! All of our volunteers are always rewarded for their contributions!

        <!-- MAME Council & Elections -->
        <div>
            <h2><b>MAME Council & Elections</b></h2>
            <p>MAME Council is run by representatives elected by the mechanical engineering students at McGill. There are eight executive positions: President, VP Internal, VP External, VP Finance, VP Academic, VP Events, VP Communications and VP Administration. Each exec has their respective responsibilities, but almost every task is completed with the help of everyone.
                <br> In addition to the main execs, every year has it's respective class representative. It is their duty to keep their peers informed about MAME and EUS news. They also work to promote departmental and faculty spirit, and to give a voice to student concerns.
                <br> Want to join MAME Council? MAME holds elections every spring, and everyone is encouraged to run regardless of experience. It is important to note that the positions of U0, U1 Rep and VP Administration are reserved for first year mechanical engineering students. Therefore, the selections/elections are held in the fall.
