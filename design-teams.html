                <h3>McGill Baja Racing</h3>
                <p>A Baja is an off-road racing vehicle, meshing the characteristics of an ATV and a dune buggy to craft an incredible racing machine. Every year, the Mcgill Baja Racing Team designs, builds, tests, and races a vehicle that they built from scratch at international collegiate competitions. The competitions comprise a number of events, focusing on both the quality and ingenuity of the design, as well as its racing ability, proven during a four hour endurance race pitting all vehicles head-to-head, where many break long before the end of the race. With consistent top performances and incredible team spirit, the McGill Baja Racing Team is team like no other. Check out their website or facebook page for more info!</p>
