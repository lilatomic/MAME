        The McGill Association of Mechanical Engineers (MAME) proudly hosts professional events over each academic year such as multi-day industry tours, CAD competitions, industry dinners, speed networking sessions, info sessions, lunch & learns and more! However, our events would not be possible without the participation of industry representatives who take the time to engage with our mechanical engineering students or the generous contributions from our lovely sponsors. For that, MAME cannot thank you enough.
        <br><br>
        If your company is interested in getting involved with MAME, the packages of our biggest events of the year are listed below in addition to our general sponsorship package. If you would like to work outside the scope of the packages below, feel free to contact MAME’s Vice President External at <a href="mailto:mame.vpexternal@mcgilleus.ca">mame.vpexternal@mcgilleus.ca</a>.

        <h3>MECH Madness</h3>
        <p>
            MECHMadness is an annual multi-day industry tour organized by MAME. The trip consists of two days of industry tours with the evenings spent sightseeing and interacting with local engineering students. This event gives mechanical engineering students at McGill University the opportunity to discover the career opportunities a degree in their field can offer all across Canada. It also provides an initial connection between companies and students who are honestly interested in what they have to offer.

        <h3>CAD|Madness</h3>
        <p>
            CAD|Madness is a weekend long design competition organized where students, in a team of 3 or 4, have 36 hours to complete a design problem. The design competition concludes with the team presenting their CAD drawings and solution to judges. The top 3 teams have the chance to win cash prizes with the possibility of the 1st place design being manufactured. If your company is interested in partnering with MAME for this event, you can read our package below for more information.

        <h3>Industry Dinner</h3>
        <p>
            Industry dinner is unique opportunity for companies to engage with McGill’s mechanical engineering students on a more personal level. The three-course meal and networking session combo allows students and company representatives to interact in a comfortable social environment. Company representatives are matched with a table of 8-10 students who have expressed an avid interest in said company. As well, each rep will have the opportunity to address the entire audience with a brief presentation about what exactly their organization does. Following the dinner is a casual networking session that allows students to interact with companies they have not yet had the opportunity to meet.

        <h3>General Sponsorship</h3>
        <p>
            A general sponsorship is a great way for interested companies to get involved with some of Canada’s best and brightest engineering students. MAME hosts a series of events every year which facilitate the building of relationships between students, their professors, and industry professionals. Sponsorships allow us to provide the most interesting and practical opportunities to our students at a fraction of the cost, if not free. While general sponsorships are extremely valuable to our students, they are also beneficial for the involved company. MAME offers a variety of perks which correspond to different levels of sponsorship. More detailed information can be found within the General Sponsorship Package found below.
