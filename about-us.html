                    <b>A bit about Myself:</b> Heya! My name is Dimitri (many people call me Dimi for short) and I’m a die hard MAMEr. I’ve been involved helping mech students since my first week at McGill. This is my fourth year working for MAME and I’m excited to continue improving student life for the mechies. As for my personal life, I love grabbing a beer and chatting with people, especially at OAP (#theBestPlaceOnEarth). I’m also an avid video game player; always down to chat about some good old fashion games. I pretty much live in MC120, so come by anytime to say hello!

                    <b>Favourite MAME-ory:</b> It may not be my favorite, but hell it’s one famous story by now. When I was in my first year, and had no idea what E-Week really was, I lost our team’s castle piece. It was a tragic moment. My team was mad. We bonded. Looking back, it was a stepping stone into an amazing time in engineering. I’ll never forget it.
