                    <p>The McGill Association of Mechanical Engineers (MAME) represents over 700 undergraduate mechanical engineering students at McGill University . The elected student council of the association provides yearlong services and events for all of the students within the mechanical engineering department. We aim to support them academically, professionally, and socially. In terms of academics, we voice all concerns and suggestions to the department in order to enrich our students’ McGill undergraduate studies. Building networks is also a big part of our goal, such that our students have as many opportunities as possible upon graduation. Moreover, MAME also strives to maintain a fun and exciting atmosphere throughout the year by organizing social events in addition to the academic and professional ones. These range from weekend long CAD competitions to end of semester banquets.
                    <br><br>
                    University is challenging. It will also be one of the best experiences in your life. MAME’s main purpose is to improve the experience for all mechanical engineering students; so take advantage of it! If you have any questions, feel free to contact us by email or stop by our office located in MC120 from 10AM-4PM. For more information regarding each of the positions and the ins-and-outs of how MAME is run, check out the <a href="pdf/MAME Constitution.pdf">MAME Constitution</a>.

        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>
            <b>What's something you think every mech student should know?</b>: You don’t have to graduate in 4 years! Tons of students spread their courses over 5 or more years to reduce stress, get involved, and pursue their passions. As I got more involved with Engineering at McGill, I found that the best idea was to take an extra year. This also gives you the freedom to take classes with the professors that are best suited to you.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>What's something about yourself that not many people know?</b>: I’m a passionate Magic: The Gathering player. In my spare time, I love collecting cards and building decks. I play casually with friends and love finding gimmicks within the game that make games fun and unique each time. I often have a deck or two in my backpack (or in the MAME office) if you ever want to learn to play, or if you want to challenge me!
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>What's your life motto?</b>: “Stay Curious”

        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>
            <b>What's something interesting about yourself that not many people know? </b>: Fun fact about me: Never read a whole book...in my life. If you find it unreal, don’t hesitate to come talk to me about it, or try to convince me to read a book, at least once.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>What's something that you think every McGill student should know? </b>: Studying in University is not just about the books, but it is also about grabbing all the opportunities the university offers you and learn from them. Get involved into student groups, learn about student diplomacy from the SSMU GAs, grasp what the city of Montreal can give you.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>What’s your life motto? </b>:
            “Vitae non Scholae Discendum”  is my high school’s motto which stands for “Learn for Life, not for School”. Personally, it is a perfect description of how we should approach anything in life: do not learn for just the moment, make it something you’ll remember always.

        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>
            <b>What's something interesting about yourself that not many people know? </b>: One time, I tried to eat 50 chicken mcnuggets and got through 43 but that’s 86% so I still snagged the A.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>What's your favourite MAME-ory? </b>: Getting to know so many people during my first MechMadness, I strongly recommend giving it a go! I met so many people who have all helped me learn so much. On top of that, it gives you a great idea of where mechanical engineering can take you after graduation.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>What’s something you think every mechie should know? </b>:
            Balance is key. It’s important to work hard but you’ll burn yourself out if you don’t take breaks every once in awhile. Join a club or find some people who share some hobbies with you because down time is just as important as work.

            <b>Favourite MAME-ory</b>: Every single MAME event. Seeing mechies come together and enjoy themselves at our socials, learn new things at our tutorials and make connections at our professional events, makes all the hard work worth it! 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>What's something that you think every mechie should know? </b>: You’re at McGill University mainly for school of course but I believe it is incredibly important to get involved in extracurricular activities to fully take advantage of your time here. There are so many different clubs, councils and teams to join that it’s easy to find a group of people that is passionate about the same things you are. It is an incredible learning experience and you have the opportunity meet people who will have a huge impact in your life. TL;DR: make sure to chill and have fun!!
            <b>What's your life motto? </b>: Live your life like Spongebob. Laugh out loud all day without any reason and annoy the mean people with your happiness.

            <b>What’s something you think every mechie / engineering / mcgill student should know? </b>:
            The best way to make it through your degree is to talk to people. Talk to upper years about course and professor selection. They are more than happy to vent about their experiences. Don’t be afraid to make new friends!
