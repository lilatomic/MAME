                    <b>A bit about Myself</b>: Heya! My name is Dimitri (many people call me Dimi for short) and I’m a die hard MAMEr. I’ve been involved helping mech students since my first week at McGill. This is my fourth year working for MAME and I’m excited to continue improving student life for the mechies. As for my personal life, I love grabbing a beer and chatting with people, especially at OAP (#theBestPlaceOnEarth). I’m also an avid video game player; always down to chat about some good old fashion games. I pretty much live in MC120, so come by anytime to say hello!

When I was in my first year, and had no idea what E-Week really was, I lost our team’s castle piece. It was a tragic moment. My team was mad. We bonded. Looking back, it was a stepping stone into an amazing time in engineering. I’ll never forget it.

                    <b>Description of Position</b>: As the U2 Rep of MAME, I act as the liason between MAME council and the U2 student body of MAME. My main responsibilities include informing MAME council of all the killer ideas that U2 MAMErs want to see come to life, as well as informing U2 MAMErs of all the awesome events that are happening. You will see me making class announcements and posting in our Facebook group frequently! I want to ensure that this year is one of your top 5 years as a member of MAME.

                    <b>A bit about Myself</b>: I am a U2 student from a small little town just outside Ottawa called Stittsville. I love anything sports related especially Hockey! This is my first year on MAME council and I honestly can’t wait to help plan awesome events and spend more time with everyone in our department! When I am not in class I am typically playing sports, studying or hanging out in the common room on Fridays from 4-9pm. Procrastinating cutting my hair is one of my favourite past times.
