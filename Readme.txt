Readme

So I figured it would help if i explained all the changes i made, where these files are now and just why i did what i did

1. Version control
Where are these files? This website, amoung many other is a git reposisitory service website. Git is a way to
version control text (and recently any sort of file) such that you can always track the history of a file and 
the changes made to it. In the software industry version control is one of the most important tools and lessons
you will need to learn and be comfortable with. Along side a text editor, version control is integral to your
workflow as a developer. Anyways, for this point forward we will be versioning our work. I will step you through
how to do this, but figured a little intro would be nice

2. Folder structure
You'll notice i split the website into a specific structure. All css in one folder, all js in another and the html at the root
diectory. This is on purpose lol, at any time, if you were to look for a specifc piece of media for your site, whether
that be an image or a javascript file you know EXACTLY where to start looking

3. Code Review
I will start reviewing your code by simply creating a commented version of one of your files. In the future i will use this 
git repo webite's review tools as it lends it self to better readability
